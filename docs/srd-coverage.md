# SRD 5.2 coverage checklist

A line-by-line worklist of what the engine implements against the
[SRD 5.2](https://www.dndbeyond.com/srd) and adjacent rule text. Use
this file as the **single source of truth for what's left** — when
something ships, check it here and reference the release in the
parenthetical.

Every section also names the release that's *planned* to close it,
linking back into [docs/roadmap.md](roadmap.md). The roadmap is the
chronological plan; this file is the topical reference. The two stay
in sync.

## Legend

- `- [x]` — shipped and tested (100/100/100). Followed by `(vX.Y.Z)`.
- `- [~]` — partial / foundation only. Sub-bullet calls out the gap.
- `- [ ]` — not started.
- *(SRD § X)* — pointer back into the [official SRD 5.2 PDF](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/srd/5.2/SRD_CC_v5.2.pdf).
- **Planned: vX.Y.Z** — under each section heading, names the
  release that's expected to close the remaining boxes in that
  section. Empty when the section is fully shipped or is parallel
  work.

When a sub-release closes a row, **update the line** rather than
appending a new "done" list — the file's value is that the unchecked
boxes are always the live worklist.

---

## 1. Core math: dice, checks, DCs

*(SRD § Playing the Game — The D20 Test, Difficulty Classes)*

**Planned:** fully shipped through v1.0.1; passive-check helper deferred until a real consumer needs it.

- [x] `Dice.roll('XdY±Z')` with parsed result *(v0.0.0)*
- [x] Single-die and explicit explosion `Dice.rollDie`, `Dice.rollExplosive` *(v0.2.0)*
- [x] Seeded RNG (`Dice.seededRng`, Mulberry32) *(v0.1.0)*
- [x] Advantage / disadvantage roll on full expression *(v0.0.0)*
- [x] Ability modifier formula `floor((score − 10) / 2)` *(v0.0.0)*
- [x] DC clamp `[5, 30]` (Very Easy → Nearly Impossible) *(v1.0.1)*
- [x] Proficiency-bonus table L1–L20 *(v0.9.0)*
- [x] XP-threshold table L1–L20 *(v0.9.0)*
- [x] Auto-success on natural 20 / auto-failure on natural 1 for **attacks** *(v0.0.0)*
- [ ] Auto-success / auto-failure on natural 20 / 1 for **non-attack D20 Tests** is *not* an SRD rule (2024 keeps crits attack-only) — document the deliberate non-implementation
- [ ] Passive checks helper (`passiveCheck(ability, prof, mods)`) — partially derived on the sheet for Perception / Insight / Investigation; no general-purpose helper

## 2. Combat math: attacks, damage, criticals

*(SRD § Playing the Game — Combat; § Equipment — Weapons)*

**Planned:** Surprise + initiative tiebreak land with [v1.7.0](roadmap.md#170--combat-actions-menu); hidden/unseen attacker bookkeeping deferred until a host needs full stealth state.

- [x] `Combat.attackRoll` with stance from conditions *(v0.7.0)*
- [x] `Combat.damageRoll` with crit (double dice, single modifier) *(v0.0.0)*
- [x] Damage floor / exploding-dice rule knobs *(v0.2.0)*
- [x] Configurable crit / fumble faces (`critOn`, `fumbleOn`) *(v0.2.0)*
- [x] Weapon Mastery: cleave, graze, nick, push, sap, slow, topple, vex *(v0.0.0, fixed v1.0.1)*
- [x] Initiative roll *(v0.0.0)*
- [x] Encounter state, turn order, action budgets *(v0.4.0)*
- [x] Opportunity attacks *(v0.4.0)*
- [x] Cover (`effectiveAc`, `COVER_BONUSES`) *(v0.4.0)*
- [x] Range bands (`rangeBand`) *(v0.4.0)*
- [x] Multi-attack count via `attacksPerAction(classDef, level)` *(v0.4.0)*
- [ ] Surprise on initiative *(SRD § Combat — Initiative)* — 2024 rules treat Surprise as "disadvantage on initiative roll"; not modelled
- [ ] Initiative tiebreak chain *(SRD § Combat — Initiative)* — higher DEX, then random
- [ ] Hidden / unseen attacker bookkeeping *(SRD § Combat — Unseen Attackers and Targets)*

## 3. Combat actions menu

*(SRD § Playing the Game — Combat — Actions)*

**Planned:** [v1.7.0](roadmap.md#170--combat-actions-menu).

- [x] Attack (resolves via `attackRoll`) *(v0.0.0)*
- [x] Cast a Spell (resolves via `Spellcasting` — slot consumption side) *(v0.5.0)*
- [ ] Dash *(SRD § Combat — Actions)*
- [ ] Disengage *(SRD § Combat — Actions)* — `opportunityAttack` accepts a `disengaged` flag but no action helper sets it
- [ ] Dodge *(SRD § Combat — Actions)* — should grant DEX-save advantage + impose disadvantage on incoming attacks
- [ ] Help *(SRD § Combat — Actions)* — advantage on next ally check / attack within 5 ft
- [ ] Hide *(SRD § Combat — Actions)*
- [ ] Ready *(SRD § Combat — Actions)*
- [ ] Search *(SRD § Combat — Actions)*
- [ ] Study *(SRD § Combat — Actions)* — 2024 action
- [ ] Influence *(SRD § Combat — Actions)* — 2024 action
- [ ] Grapple — fixed-DC `8 + STR + prof`, applies the `grappled` condition *(SRD § Combat — Actions; 2024 single-DC change)*
- [ ] Shove — fixed-DC `8 + STR + prof`, applies `prone` or push 5 ft *(SRD § Combat — Actions)*
- [ ] Two-Weapon Fighting — bonus-action off-hand attack, no ability mod on damage; interacts with Nick mastery *(SRD § Equipment — Light, Nick)*
- [ ] Improvised attacks (d4 default) *(SRD § Equipment — Improvised Weapons)*
- [ ] Mounted Combat *(SRD § Combat — Mounted Combat)*
- [ ] Object interaction (free, one per turn) *(SRD § Combat — Other Activity on Your Turn)*

## 4. Conditions

*(SRD § Playing the Game — Conditions)*

**Planned:** [v1.5.0](roadmap.md#150--condition-system-completion); save-at-end-of-turn binding rides on [v1.6.0](roadmap.md#160--turn-lifecycle-hooks--time-tracking).

- [x] 14 boolean conditions: blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, grappled, incapacitated, invisible, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, restrained, stunned, unconscious *(v0.0.0)*
- [x] Numeric Exhaustion 0–6 (−2/level on D20 Tests, −5 ft/level on Speed, death at 6) *(v0.0.0)*
- [x] Mechanical effect map (`CONDITION_EFFECTS`) folded into attack stance *(v0.7.0)*
- [x] `apply` / `remove` / `has` immutable helpers *(v0.0.0)*
- [ ] **Condition immunity** — actor-side filter `actor.conditionImmunities: [...]` on `apply` *(SRD § Monsters — Immunities)*
- [ ] **Auto-fail STR/DEX saves** on paralyzed / stunned / petrified / unconscious — the flag exists, the binding into `savingThrow` doesn't *(SRD condition entries)*
- [ ] **Auto-crit from within 5 ft** on paralyzed / unconscious / petrified / stunned — flag exists, not yet folded into `attackRoll`'s `critical` *(SRD condition entries)*
- [ ] **Per-application metadata** — condition entries are bare strings; no source / DC / duration so `save at end of turn` effects can't end themselves
- [ ] **Save-to-end-of-turn** ongoing effects *(SRD: Hold Person, Hideous Laughter, Charm Monster, etc.)*

## 5. Damage pipeline

*(SRD § Playing the Game — Damage and Healing)*

**Planned:** [v1.4.0](roadmap.md#140--damage-pipeline).

- [ ] **Resistance** — halve damage of a tagged type *(SRD § Damage and Healing — Resistance)*
- [ ] **Vulnerability** — double damage of a tagged type *(SRD § Damage and Healing — Vulnerability)*
- [ ] **Immunity** — zero damage of a tagged type / no condition application *(SRD § Damage and Healing — Immunity)*
- [ ] **Order of application** — adjustments → Resistance → Vulnerability *(SRD § Damage and Healing — Damage)*
- [ ] **Temporary HP** — non-stacking buffer, replace if larger, expires on Long Rest *(SRD § Damage and Healing — Temporary HP)*
- [ ] **Damage type surfaced from `damageRoll`** — item records carry type but the roll result doesn't propagate it
- [ ] `Combat.applyDamage(actor, { amount, type, critical? })` — canonical helper that combines the above, integrates `applyDamageWhileDown`, and triggers `dropToZero` when HP crosses 0

## 6. Healing & death

*(SRD § Playing the Game — Damage and Healing — Healing / Death Saving Throws)*

**Planned:** generic `Combat.heal` lands with [v1.4.0](roadmap.md#140--damage-pipeline); stable creatures regaining 1 HP rides on [v1.6.0](roadmap.md#160--turn-lifecycle-hooks--time-tracking)'s scene clock.

- [x] Death save mechanic (`Combat.deathSave`) — DC 10, 3/3 threshold, nat 1 = two failures, nat 20 = revive *(v1.1.0)*
- [x] `Combat.dropToZero` — applies Unconscious + tracker *(v1.1.0)*
- [x] `Combat.applyDamageWhileDown` — damage at 0 = 1 failure (2 on crit), massive damage = instant death *(v1.1.0)*
- [x] `Combat.stabilize`, `Combat.reviveTo` *(v1.1.0)*
- [x] Rule knobs: `deathSaveDC`, `deathSaveSuccessesRequired` *(v1.1.0)*
- [ ] **Stable creatures regain 1 HP after 1d4 hours** *(SRD § Damage and Healing — Stabilizing)*
- [ ] `Combat.heal(actor, amount)` — generic healing that caps at hpMax and removes Unconscious if HP > 0 *(SRD § Damage and Healing — Healing)*
- [ ] `Combat.maximizeHP(actor)` — for *Heal* / *Power Word Heal*-style spells

## 7. Rest mechanics

*(SRD § Playing the Game — Short Rest, Long Rest)*

**Planned:** core mechanics shipped through v1.3.0; dawn/dusk timers + interrupted-rest semantics ride on [v1.6.0](roadmap.md#160--turn-lifecycle-hooks--time-tracking) and [v1.18.0](roadmap.md#1180--travel--exploration) respectively.

- [x] `Rest.spendHitDie(actor)` — die + CON mod, min 1, caps at hpMax *(v1.2.0)*
- [x] `Rest.longRest(actor)` — full HP, half hit dice back, exhaustion -1, slot refill, death-save reset *(v1.2.0)*
- [x] `Rest.shortRest(actor)` — warlock pact slots + short-tagged resources *(v1.3.0)*
- [x] Rule knob `longRestHitDiceRecovery: half | all | none` *(v1.2.0)*
- [ ] **Interrupted rest** semantics *(SRD § Long Rest)* — a rest broken by 1+ hour of activity yields no benefits
- [ ] **Dawn / dusk timers** — magic item charges, certain spells *(SRD § Magic Items — Activating a Magic Item)*
- [ ] **Resting in dangerous terrain** *(SRD § Adventuring — Travel Pace)*

## 8. Movement, vision, exploration

*(SRD § Playing the Game — Movement; § Adventuring — Vision and Light)*

**Planned:** movement modes + vision in [v1.11.0](roadmap.md#1110--movement-modes--vision); travel pace + forced march in [v1.18.0](roadmap.md#1180--travel--exploration).

- [x] Single `speed` value derived (post-condition / exhaustion) *(v0.7.0)*
- [ ] **Per-mode speeds** — walk / fly / swim / climb / burrow *(SRD § Adventuring — Special Types of Movement)*
- [ ] **Difficult terrain** — each foot costs 2 feet *(SRD § Adventuring — Movement)*
- [ ] **Falling damage** — 1d6 per 10 ft, max 20d6, prone on landing *(SRD § Adventuring — Falling)*
- [ ] **Long / high jump** — STR-mod ft horizontal, 3 + STR mod ft vertical *(SRD § Adventuring — Movement)*
- [ ] **Crawling** — each foot costs 2 feet *(SRD § Conditions — Prone interaction)*
- [ ] **Travel pace** — slow / normal / fast tables *(SRD § Adventuring — Travel Pace)*
- [ ] **Forced march, starvation, suffocation, drowning** *(SRD § Adventuring — Between Adventures)*
- [ ] **Light levels** — bright / dim / darkness *(SRD § Adventuring — Vision and Light)*
- [ ] **Special senses** — darkvision (range), blindsight, tremorsense, truesight *(SRD § Monsters — Senses)*
- [ ] **Heavily / lightly obscured** *(SRD § Adventuring — Vision and Light)*
- [ ] **Line of sight / line of effect** — separate from cover *(SRD § Spells — Targets)*

## 9. Time and duration tracking

*(cross-cutting; SRD § Adventuring — Time)*

**Planned:** [v1.6.0](roadmap.md#160--turn-lifecycle-hooks--time-tracking).

- [ ] **Round timer** — start-of-turn tick that expires `1 round` effects
- [ ] **Save-at-end-of-turn** — applied effect carries `{ saveAbility, saveDC, endsOn: 'turnEnd' }`
- [ ] **Minute / hour / day clocks** — scene clock the host can advance
- [ ] **Spell-duration ticker** — `actor.activeSpells: [{ spellId, level, remainingRounds }]`
- [ ] **Dawn / dusk event** — fires magic-item recharge handlers

## 10. Spellcasting — slots & concentration

*(SRD § Spells — Casting Spells, Components, Concentration)*

**Planned:** concentration auto-drop in [v1.5.0](roadmap.md#150--condition-system-completion); concentration auto-binding + one-leveled-spell-per-turn + upcast deltas in [v1.8.0](roadmap.md#180--spellcasting-completion).

- [ ] **Auto-drop concentration** on incapacitated / stunned / paralyzed / unconscious / petrified / dead *(SRD § Spells — Concentration)*
- [ ] **`spell.concentration` flag** on spell records + auto-`startConcentration` on cast
- [ ] **One leveled spell per turn rule** *(SRD § Spells — Casting a Spell — "you can cast only one leveled spell on a turn")*
- [ ] **Casting from a slot of higher level** — handler receives `castLevel`; spell records carry `upcast` deltas *(SRD § Spells — Casting at a Higher Level)*

## 11. Spellcasting — components & casting modes

*(SRD § Spells — Components, Ritual)*

**Planned:** [v1.8.0](roadmap.md#180--spellcasting-completion); spell scrolls + wands tie into [v1.9.0](roadmap.md#190--magic-items-system) magic-item charges.

- [ ] **Somatic component** flag + free-hand check *(SRD § Spells — Somatic Components)*
- [ ] **Material component** flag, optional cost + consumed *(SRD § Spells — Material Components)*
- [ ] **Component pouch / spellcasting focus** substitution *(SRD § Spells — Material Components — Focus)*
- [ ] **Ritual casting** — `castAsRitual(spell, caster)`, +10 min, no slot, prepared-only *(SRD § Spells — Ritual)*
- [ ] **Casting time variants** — 1 action, bonus, reaction (trigger), 1 minute, 10 minutes, 1 hour *(SRD § Spells — Casting Time)*
- [ ] **Spell scrolls** — `castFromScroll(spell, caster)` *(SRD § Magic Items — Spell Scrolls)*

- [ ] **`castSpellSave(spell, targets, dc)`** — rolls each target's save, tags half-damage / failure outcome
- [ ] **`saveForHalf` outcome shape** — standardised result for half-damage-on-save spells *(SRD many spells)*
- [ ] **Evasion / Magic Resistance / Sculpt Spells** modifiers on save outcomes *(SRD § Classes — Rogue / Monk; § Monsters — Magic Resistance)*

- [ ] Starvation / Thirst — exhaustion accrual *(SRD § Adventuring — Food and Water)*
- [ ] Extreme heat / cold *(SRD § Adventuring — Environment)*

## 23. Audit / replay surface

*(non-SRD; engine-internal)*

**Planned:** [v1.23.0](roadmap.md#1230--audit--replay-surface-completion).

- [x] Append-only `engine.rollLog` *(v0.1.0)*
- [x] `verifyLog` with seed + rules *(v0.1.0)*
- [x] Context tags on every roll *(v0.1.0)*
- [x] `deathSave` op recorded *(v1.1.0)*
- [x] `spendHitDie` recorded as `rollDie` *(v1.2.0)*
- [x] Class-mechanic-internal `rollDie` calls flow into the log *(v1.3.0)*
- [ ] **`mechanicApplied` op** — log the resource transition + result kind, not just the dice
- [ ] **Hook fire log** — optional `hookFired` entries for plugin-stack debugging
- [ ] **Rule-knob fingerprint in the log header** — death-save DC, hit-dice recovery, etc., so cross-pack replays diverge at the boundary not silently
- [ ] **`deathSave` previousFailures / previousSuccesses snapshot** for full reconstructability

## 24. Plugin system

*(non-SRD; engine architecture)*

**Planned:** [v1.22.0](roadmap.md#1220--plugin-surface-expansion). Phase D hook events are emitted as their feature releases land; this milestone consolidates them as a documented contract.

- [x] **Phase A (content)** — extraSpecies / Classes / Backgrounds / Feats / Spells / Items / Conditions / Mastery / Monsters *(v0.0.0 → v0.6.0)*
- [x] **Phase B (rules)** — critOn, fumbleOn, damageFloor, explodingDamageDice, xpThresholds, proficiencyByLevel, deathSaveDC, deathSaveSuccessesRequired, longRestHitDiceRecovery *(v0.2.0 → v1.2.0)*
- [x] **Phase C (hooks)** — beforeAttack, afterDamage, onLevelUp, onConditionApplied, onDeath *(v0.3.0)*
- [ ] **onTurnStart / onTurnEnd** hooks — needed for save-at-end-of-turn effects (§ 9), Sneak Attack reset (§ 13), spell-duration tick (§ 9)
- [ ] **onLongRest / onShortRest** hooks — plugin extension point for rest-based class features
- [ ] **onCast** hook — fires before slot consumption; enables Counterspell-style reaction-cast wiring
- [ ] **extraResources** plugin contribution — let custom classes register resource shapes generically
- [ ] **extraMechanics** plugin contribution — class-feature handlers contributable without forking the class def

## 25. Documentation & host contracts

*(non-SRD; project hygiene)*

**Planned:** [v1.24.0](roadmap.md#1240--documentation--host-contract-sweep).

- [x] `docs/why.md`, `docs/boundary.md`, `docs/spec.md`, `docs/recipes.md`, `docs/roadmap.md`, `docs/character-sheet.md`, `docs/beat-schema.md`
- [x] `docs/srd-coverage.md` *(this file)*
- [ ] **`character-sheet.md` schema additions** — `hp`, `hpMax`, `hitDie`, `hitDiceTotal`, `hitDiceUsed`, `deathSaves`, `resources`, `concentration`, `spellSlots`, plus per-class flags like `sneakAttackUsedThisTurn`
- [ ] **`recipes.md` additions** — Death Saves flow, Rest flow, Mechanics dispatch, plugin-contribute a class
- [ ] **`spec.md` plugin contract update** — new rule knobs, resource-spec shape, mechanic handler signature
- [ ] **Kernel-boundary checklist** — what the engine claims to enforce vs. what's host-owned, at a glance
- [ ] **TypeDoc-style reference site** *(deferred from 1.0.0)*

## How we sequence work from this file

When picking the next branch:

1. **Prefer rows that unlock other rows.** §5 Damage pipeline unlocks §19 monster resistances and §11 components; §9 Time tracking unlocks §11 ritual + §12 spell durations + §15 effects.
2. **Group related rows into a single release.** §3 combat actions ship best as a coherent batch (one PR for Dash/Dodge/Disengage/Help/Hide/Ready/Search) rather than one-per-action.
3. **Match release size to risk.** Foundation-changing sections (§5, §9, §11) deserve their own minor release; data-only sections (§16 magic items A–Z, §19 monster expansion) can chain through multiple patch releases.
4. **Update the checkbox in the same commit** that ships the feature. The checklist drifts the moment "shipped" isn't reflected here.
